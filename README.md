    Create visualizations such as heatmaps or geographic plots to display disease distribution and trends.

5. Enhance Model and Application Integration

Advantages:

    Improved efficiency and user experience through robust backend and frontend integration.
    Facilitates continuous improvement and adaptability of the system.

Action Steps:

    Regularly update and retrain the model with new data to improve accuracy and adapt to emerging diseases.
